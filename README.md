# General Information
arXiv is a highly-automated electronic archive and distribution server for research articles. Covered areas include physics, [mathematics](https://arxiv.org/archive/math), [computer science](https://arxiv.org/archive/cs), [nonlinear sciences](https://arxiv.org/archive/nlin), [quantitative biology](https://arxiv.org/archive/q-bio), [quantitative finance](https://arxiv.org/archive/q-fin), and [statistics](https://arxiv.org/archive/stat).
This repository try to explain/introduce you useful informations in Cyber Security field.
## unique identifier(or archive and paper number)
All arXiv submissions are assigned a unique identifier of the form yymm.nnnn (or arch-ive/yymmnnn for older submissions).All new articles have identifiers with the following form:

**arXiv:YYMM.number**  
e.g. arXiv:1501.00001 or arXiv:0706.0001

where identifiers up to month 1412 are zero-padded to 4-digits in the last block, and those from 1501 onward are zero-padded to 5-digits. Specific versions are referred to by adding the version number:

**arXiv:YYMM.numbervV**  
e.g. arXiv:1501.00001v1 or arXiv:0706.0001v2

In general, the form is arXiv:YYMM.number{vV}, where

**YY** is the two-digit year (07=2007 through 99=2099, and potentially up to 06=2106)  
**MM** is the two-digit month number (01=Jan,...12=Dec)  
number is a zero-padded sequence number of 4- or 5-digits. From 0704 through 1412 it is 4-digits, starting at 0001. From 1501 on it is 5-digits, starting at 00001. 5-digits permits up to 99999 submissions per month. We cannot currently anticipate more then 99999 submissions per month although extension to 6-digits would be possible.  
**vV** is a literal v followed by a version number of 1 or more digits starting at v1.

## Indiscriminate automated downloads(crowling) from arXiv are not permitted
arXiv has limited server capacity and our first priority is to support interactive use by our many human users.  
Several interfaces designed to provide machine access to arXiv are provided. See arXiv [OAI-PMH](https://arxiv.org/help/oa), [arXiv API](https://arxiv.org/help/api/index) and [RSS documentation](https://arxiv.org/help/rss). There are also facilities for bulk data download.
